# Project_Change_Color_Background
Simple JavaScript Project that changes background each time a button is pressed.

# Result
In a file script.js. First solution with only 1 button was asked (choosing the color from a given array of colors). I finally commited second solution which has a second button and generates random RGB color(I had to change the HTML file to tell the buttons apart by ID). Now you can choose if you want the pre-defined color (then press first button) or you want a random color (then press the second button).
